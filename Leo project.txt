Table that has a list of all Serial numbers, and you can add more serial numbers,but you can add the rest of the information later. 
So by default the other data is null and we be replace once information has being add to the serial number information 
Intial table

Serial number | Date last work on | Total Hours on Unit | Total Cost
12131               NULL	       NULL			NuLL


Serial number will be a hyper link that takes the user to a table of more detail information of the equipment.

In this table the following information can be add and delete  "The delete information is going be admin only"
Information that can be add to the serial number will go as follow. The name of the operator who is using the equipment. 
The hours work on the unit, and the date the unit was work on. 
And what was done to the equipment.
				
			Serial Number
Operator Name | Hours on Unit | Date MM/DD/YYYY  |    Work perform |   Cost
John Smith	  3.5		  08/01/2020		Oil Change     100

Operator name- 
Hours on Unit- 
Date -
Work perform - 

Once the information has being add to the serial number then what was add last will be use to pull the "Date last work on".
For total hours on unit and total cost we will use the tables to calculated the the cost and hours. 


So in total we are going to need to use 3 pages maybe 4 pages
Login - Admin 
Intial page - This will contain the intial table- can add serial numbers 
Serial Number page - This will contain the information that was add to the serial numbers. 
Add info page - We will use this page to add information to the serial number. 

I am planning on hosting the website with aws.
